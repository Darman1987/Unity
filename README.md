# 🚗 Unity Basic Car Controller

This is a simple Unity project that implements a basic player-controlled car driving system. It's perfect as a learning resource or a starting point for more complex driving mechanics in 3D games.

## 🎮 Included Scripts

### `PlayerController.cs`

This script handles the movement of the player-controlled vehicle. It allows for basic acceleration and steering, and simulates simple driving mechanics. It can be easily adjusted to include more realistic physics or features like braking, reversing, or drifting.

**Features:**
- Forward movement and vehicle rotation
- Input control using `WASD` or arrow keys

### `FollowPlayer.cs`

This script makes the camera smoothly follow the vehicle, staying behind the player to enhance the driving experience.

**Features:**
- Third-person camera follow
- Adjustable position via the Unity Inspector

- Unity (recommended version 2020.3 LTS or newer)
- Basic scene setup with a vehicle and a camera
